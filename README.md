# 🏡 Housing Price Regression – Python Project

This project explores housing price data using Python and builds a regression model to predict prices based on features such as living area and location. It is based on a mandatory assignment in data analysis and machine learning.

## 📊 Summary

The goal of the project is to:

* Load and clean housing data
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Build and evaluate a linear regression model using scikit-learn
* Visualize relationships between features and target variable

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
